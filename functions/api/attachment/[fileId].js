/**
 * GET /api/attachment/<fileId>  -> the actual image/file bytes, proxied
 * live from Telegram — nothing is stored on our side.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: an agent's reply attachment (sent via
 * functions/api/threads/[id].js's "reply" action) is only ever uploaded
 * to Telegram — no copy of it lives anywhere in R2 or KV, by deliberate
 * choice (business owner wanted the "click to view" feature WITHOUT
 * using any of our own storage). What DOES get saved is Telegram's own
 * `file_id` for that upload (see attachmentFileId on the message
 * record). This route is what turns that file_id back into real,
 * viewable bytes, on demand, only at the moment someone actually clicks
 * to look — nothing is fetched or cached ahead of time.
 *
 * How it works: Telegram's Bot API splits "get a file" into two calls —
 * `getFile` (resolves a file_id to a temporary `file_path`) then a
 * separate download endpoint using that path. Both calls need
 * TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, which must NEVER reach the browser (the download
 * URL's path literally embeds the token: .../bot<TOKEN>/<file_path>) —
 * so this proxies the actual response body straight through instead of
 * ever redirecting the browser to a Telegram URL. Same reasoning as why
 * R2 attachments are served through /api/screenshot/<key> rather than a
 * raw bucket URL — the browser only ever talks to our own domain.
 *
 * Login-gated like every other thread-related endpoint — this doesn't
 * separately check which brand the file "belongs to" (a file_id alone
 * doesn't carry that info without a KV lookup this route deliberately
 * skips for simplicity), so treat this as "any logged-in agent can view
 * any attachment if they somehow get its file_id" — acceptable since
 * file_ids aren't guessable/enumerable (they're long opaque Telegram-
 * issued strings) and are only ever handed out via the thread data an
 * agent could already see.
 *
 * Trade-off worth knowing: Telegram file_ids are generally retrievable
 * for as long as the file exists on Telegram's own servers (no fixed
 * expiry like the temporary download URL has), but that's Telegram's
 * behavior, not a guarantee this code makes — if Telegram ever can't
 * resolve an old file_id, this route surfaces that as a clean error
 * rather than a broken image, see the response below.

  // Priority order, most-to-least trustworthy:
  //   1. Guessing from the ORIGINAL filename the agent uploaded (we
  //      already know this on our own side — e.g. "photo.jpg" — it's
  //      the one piece of information Telegram never had a chance to
  //      lose or mangle, see the comment above).
  //   2. Telegram's own Content-Type header for the download — but
  //      SKIPPED if it's just the generic "application/octet-stream",
  //      since that's Telegram effectively saying "I don't know either"
  //      and blindly trusting it would short-circuit past the better
  //      guesses below.
  //   3. Guessing from Telegram's own internal file_path.
  //   4. Magic-bytes sniffing (read the file's actual header bytes) —
  //      only reached when 1–3 all came up empty, i.e. filename AND
  //      both Telegram-provided type hints are gone. This is the case
  //      for old records that never had a filename saved and whose
  //      file_path/Content-Type were already generic at upload time —
  //      filename/metadata are dead ends there, so the file's own bytes
  //      are the only signal left, and they're never lost as long as
  //      the file content itself isn't corrupted.
  //   5. Whatever Telegram's header said, even if generic.
  //   6. Hardcoded fallback, if genuinely nothing else worked out.
  //
  // MERGED (2026-08-21) — layer 4 (magic-bytes sniffing) was missing
  // from this file entirely: all three original per-country projects
  // (INR/PKR/PHP) independently added it, converging on the exact same
  // idea by hand three separate times — a real signal it was worth
  // having, not optional polish. Ported from PHP's version specifically
  // (the most refined of the three: short-circuits to a streamed
  // response when layers 1–3 already succeeded, only buffers the whole
  // file into memory — unavoidable cost for byte-sniffing — when
  // genuinely nothing else worked; PKR/INR always buffered even when a
  // preliminary type was already known). Without this layer, a very old
  // attachment record with no saved filename AND a generic Telegram
  // Content-Type would get served as bare "application/octet-stream" —
  // an `<img>`/`<video>` tag refuses to render that, so threads.html's
  // own error handler falls back to treating it as a plain download
  // link rather than an inline preview; this layer is what lets those
